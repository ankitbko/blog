My name is Ankit Sinha. I currently work at Microsoft as Software Developer. I started by career as a developer in 2013 and have thoroughly enjoyed the work.

I am a technology enthusiast and love to dig in emerging technologies. In my career, I have designed architecture and successfully delivered products for multiple companies. 

Outside professional life, I spend most my time playing computer games, reading books, keeping myself up to date with new technologies and trying to break *(into)* stuffs.â˜º
